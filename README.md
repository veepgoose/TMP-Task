## Contact-A-Cat Business Directory

Thank you for considering my application for the developer role at The Marketing Pod. Below, I'll outline my process, approach, and implementation of the technical task.

### Process

1. **Initial Research**: Upon receiving the task brief, I started by familiarising myself with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I reviewed Vite's documentation, refreshed my knowledge of TypeScript through online courses, and explored Tailwind CSS documentation to understand its utility classes.

2. **Data Exploration**: I began by fetching data from the provided API endpoint to understand its structure and content. This helped me conceptualise the application's layout and functionality.

3. **Ideation**: Based on the data and requirements, I conceptualised a Business Directory for Cats named "Contact-A-Cat." I envisioned a simple dashboard displaying cat profiles, a modal for editing or deleting cats, and an edit user page resembling a contact card.

### Approach

1. **Dashboard**: I opted for a clean and simple layout, displaying cat profiles with their images, first names, and last names. This minimalist approach aimed for a user-friendly interface.

2. **Modal**: The modal presented two primary options: editing cat details and deleting the cat. I kept the modal's design straightforward to maintain focus on functionality.

3. **Edit User Page**: For the edit user page, I designed a form resembling a contact card, providing fields for first name, last name, email, phone, and address. This layout aimed for clarity and ease of use.

### Implementation

- **API Integration**: I utilised the provided API endpoint to fetch user data and simulate CRUD operations.
- **Routing**: I leveraged React Router for page navigation, creating routes for the dashboard and edit user page.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS facilitated rapid styling with its utility classes. I opted for a colorful palette, rounded profile images, and a clean UI design.
- **Functionality**: I implemented functionalities such as editing user details, deleting users, and basic pagination for enhanced user experience.

### Additional Functionalities

- **Pagination**: Implemented basic pagination to enhance the dashboard's usability and improve load times.
- **Sorting**: Added sorting options by first and last names to facilitate easier navigation through the user list.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provided an opportunity to with a new framework - Vite, further my TypeScript learning, and Tailwind CSS while showcasing my ability to design and develop a functional web application. I enjoyed the challenge and look forward to discussing my solution and any potential improvements further.
